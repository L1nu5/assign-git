1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
- A .gitignore file contains file type extensions for which git should not track the changes on.
- For Java project, these files gitignore should include these file types:
    Normally: .class, .log, .ctxt, .jar, .war, .ear, .nar, rar, .zip
    In case of eclipse: .project, .settings
    
2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
- It provides an option for a current branch head to move to the target branch if the current branch has not diverged.
  i.e. it will not create a new merge-commit for the current branch. 
  (Alternatively, if the current HEAD is a predecessor of the commit being merged, then current head will just point to that commit.)

3. Why should you have different branches?
- Different branches provide multiple teams on the same project to work independently. It also provides isolation.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
- A project has only one remote repository.
